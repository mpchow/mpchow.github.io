# My Personal Website!
My 1st iteration of my personal website built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript hosted on Netlify.

You can check it out at [matthewchow.me](matthewchow.me)

I'm currently working on a new version of my website with React now that I have a better understanding of web development and good practice!
